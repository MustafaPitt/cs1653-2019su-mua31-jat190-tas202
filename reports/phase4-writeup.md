# Phase 3 Report

# brainstorm
T5 = Message reorder, replay, mod --- idea is to add a submsg to each envelope that has a sequence # and/or a time durration
        reorder = for each msg on a line of communication create a random int that will be a counter for that session. Send it with each message and increment for each message.
        replay = already secure (due to DH)
        mod = hash and sign each message

T6 = File Leakage ----  Files when uploaded will be encrypted w/ with a group key
              group key will be generated when a group is created. The formula is Ki = h(longterm_Secret || i). The long term secret will be generated by the GS stored in a gkey.bin as well as a hmap<group, gkey[]> on the users token.
              Also, on the token we want int cur_gkey_version_num;
              Upload=> encrypt file with  ^.
              FS will now store <filename, gkey_version_num> for each file  //file_list??
              Download=> return <filename, gkey_version_num>, and decrypt the file.

              Note: All outdated encrypted files on FS will be leaked once the key is updated (member is removed). --Don't have to fix this yet because it is backwards secrecy.

T7 = Token Theft ---- Add a field to each token that includes the public key of the FS it will immediately be used on. The client   knows the FS's pubkey, they will send this to the GS when their token is generated and it will be added to a field then. Then this token will be usable only on the FSwith the corresponding private key it has associated with it. If it is stolen it can still only be used on that FS.
